# OasisViewer

The goal of this project is to create a computational geometry viewer using the Oasis file format. It is a work in progress.

Currently it is capable of creating and viewing files that contain simple layouts with a few compatible geometries. However, the files do not currently seem to work with official Oasis Viewers.
